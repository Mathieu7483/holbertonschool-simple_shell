# 📚 holbertonschool-simple_shell
Welcome to my holbertonschool-simple_shell repository! This directory marks the beginning of my intensive journey into learning the C programming language, with a strong focus on low-level programming. It compiles the exercises completed as part of my training, centered around building a simple shell in collaboration with two fellow students: Mathis and Heytem.

Through these projects, my goal is to develop a deep understanding of how programs work "under the hood"—exploring memory management, compilation processes, and direct interactions with the operating system.

## *The project is organized around the progressive implementation of the simple shell and its functionalities.*

### Tasks

# ⚙️ Compilation
The files in this project are compiled using gcc with the following options:

```bash

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
To check for memory leaks, use:

```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full ./simple_shell
```

To access the manpage:
```bash
~/Holberton/holbertonschool-simple_shell$man ./man_1_simple_shell
```
